After all, if you\u2019re going to do something, do it well. In January 2018, SparkFun celebrated its 15-year anniversary. A lot has changed since our humble beginnings in a Boulder college apartment. Curious about how we went from one guy mailing boxes out of a basement to 140 employees in an 80,000-square-foot building? Check out SparkFun founder Nate's very detailed history of the company (it even includes a Viking funeral).Read our StoryOur products and resources carry no patents, so anyone can use, modify and even sell them. Madness, you say? So far so good. Being open source encourages people to share and learn from each other. It also forces us to focus on what we do best and constantly innovate.

Through our Community Partnership Program, we\u2019ve donated supplies, parts and expertise to over 140 projects, universities and programs in six countries in the first half of 2017 alone, with awards issued every month.View our Community Partnership efforts. We produce, build, test and assemble over 400 open source kits and boards from our catalog in-house. It\u2019s the best way we know to ensure the red box you receive contains products you know, love and can rely on. And if something should go wrong, our tech support and customer service teams are here to help, no matter what.Take a look at our manufacturing process.Everyone deserves access to electronics literacy. In our Department of Education, we believe electronics are more than a hobby or career path; they\u2019re a creative medium for teaching and learning. Since 2009, we\u2019ve helped students and educators around the world introduce these tools and concepts into their schools.View our maker education-focused website.In 2008, CEO Nate bet Director of Engineering Pete that he couldn\u2019t build a robot able to circumnavigate the building by itself. Nine years and countless dramatic crashes later, SparkFun\u2019s Autonomous Vehicle Competition brings competitors, robots and spectators from around the world together to see what happens when machines are left to their own devices.\nMore about AVCIt\u2019s in our name - we\u2019re here to have fun. In addition to the thrill we get from playing with electronics every day, we also bring our dogs to work, gather around the office kegs at the end of the day, enjoy the incredible Colorado summers together at Friday BBQs and take turns scaling the climbing wall in our gym. It\u2019s a tough job, but someone has to do it. Check out our current job openings!In effort to lower our impact on the environment, our headquarters uses smart energy power outlets, e-waste recycling and community bicycle programs, and a photovoltaic rooftop solar array that provides around 30 percent of our monthly electricity. Our building was also the first in Boulder County to be built according to the International Green Construction Code.Weekly product releases, special offers, and more.", "attributeinfo": {"subpageName": "about_sparkfun"}}

{"infourl": "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction/", "entity": "arduino", "entitytype": "Competitor", "text": "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.\nArduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments.Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.\nTeachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, for example.\nArduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. Arduino also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, and interested amateurs over other systems:Inexpensive - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than \\$50Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.Simple, clear programming environment - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.Open source and extensible hardware - The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.See the getting started guide. If you are looking for inspiration you can find a great variety of Tutorials on Arduino Project Hub.The text of the Arduino getting started guide is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License.
